# MSQCmodel

This is a new approach to the MSQC model which is built on the MatPsi (link) package.

## Model Form
  
  Modify the integrals of the hamiltonian by scaling parameters : 
  
    H1(p) , J(p) , K(p) [Dave, can you please explain how you want the model form here, please]
    
    off and on diag separate 
    
    scaling  -- > c*p
    
    ...
    
## User Interface
The model will consist of three key parts:
    -Dataset format
    -Data loading function
    -Fitting data function

### dataset format
Could potentially use the dataset from [quantum-machine](http://quantum-machine.org/index.php?page=datasets "Title") or generate substituted hydrocarbons.

## Architecture 
  - Need to work on this
