# MSQCmodel

This is a new approach to the MSQC model which is built on the MatPsi (link) package.

## Model Form
  
  Modify the integrals of the hamiltonian by scaling parameters : 
  
    H1(p) , J(p) , K(p) [Dave, can you please explain how you want the model form here please]
    
    scaling  -- > c*p
    
    ...
